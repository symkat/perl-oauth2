Revision history for LWP-Authen-OAuth2

0.01    20130711 - 3:13 PM PDT
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world with much
        documentation and no useful tests.

        *sigh*  My machine was not running all of the tests that module
        starter installed.  Other environments did, and therefore failed.
        Removed or fixed those.  (Really, I do not want to have end user
        documentation in subclasses of parent methods that they were
        supposed to override.)

        - Find more dependencies.
        - Rename flow to client_type in many places.
        - Rename *_more_* to *_optional_* in ServiceProvider.
        - Rename *_defaults to *_init to be more descriptive.
        - Another documentation pass.

        - Add Module::Load dependency
        - Catch that the Google service provider was missing
          s/flow/client_type/.
        - Make syntax errors in a service provider less confusing to debug.
